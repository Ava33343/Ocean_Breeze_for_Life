# Panel Design

_After running the "panel serve dashboard.ipynb" as a command,_
_Figures created from hvplot are displayed in the panel_
_However, the panel does not display corresponding figures from plotly express._

_*The design is as follows*_
               Supply              |       Annual_Bar       |     Annual_Line            |                Neighborhood          |       Analysis              
---------------------------------- | -----------------------|----------------------------| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------
How Many Housing Units Are There?     |  Think Or Swim         | See Trends in San Francisco|                 Nailed It!           |  Home. Sweet Home!

   Figure 1a                                |     Figure 2a          |         Figure 3a          |           Figure 4                  | Figure 6a and 6b    
         Figure 1b                            |  Figure 2b             |       Figure 3b            |            Figure 5                  |  Figure  7
